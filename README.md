# Mining Country Indicators using Big Data Approach
The purposes of this project are to explore relationships and to forecast values
of country indicators using big data approach. We started by collecting historical
data of country indicators from eight online sources and unifying them into the
same format. Next, we explored relationships between target variables and other
country indicators using MINE statistics and data clustering. After that, forecasting
models based on data mining techniques with feature selection were created and
compared to other benchmarks and forecasting approaches. The results show that
several intriguing relationships between indicators were exposed in the exploration
step and the forecasting step also gave high-quality results. Together these results
assert that big data approach is a practical tool supporting both country development
and investment risk evaluation.
